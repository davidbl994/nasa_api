# NASA API Project

This project demonstrates the use of Python to interact with NASA APIs, showcasing skills in Python,
pytest, and the 'requests' library. The project is organized to demostrate best practices in project
structure, API interaction, and testing strategies, focusing on GET requests due to the nature of the NASA APIs.

## Project Overview

This project leverages the following NASA APIs:
- **Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)**: Retrieves imagery and associated data from NASA's APOD service.
- **Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs)**: Provides information on near-Earth objects, allowing users to search for asteroids
based on their closest approach to Earth, lookup specific asteroids by their NASA JPL small body ID, and browse the overall dataset.
